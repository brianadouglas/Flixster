## Notes

My main challenges came with the configuration of the views. The constraints weren't that intuitive and it caused me to have to fiddle with the layouts for a while.
Also, some of my class names conflicted with those already in Androidx, which then to conflict resolution errors that took me a while to figure out.
I also tried to implement the Butterknife stretch step but kept running into issues with version conflicts of several of the packages.
